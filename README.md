# HOME AUTOMATION (IR remote)
This project is based on the concept of HOME AUTOMATION.
Install this system in the respective switch boards (circuit board) and enjoy controlling the your appliances via remote.

HARDWARE REQUIRED:
  > Arduino
  > LCD display 
  > IR remote
  > IR reciever
  > Relay (we have used 4 channel relay)
  > RTC Ds3231
  
SOFTWARE REQUIRED:
  > Arduino IDE
  
 Features:
  > Instant on/off any appliance
  > Set on/off time
  > View,reset timer 
  > View Status of every appliance
  
# Get Started
Before getting started with the project (combining all the gardware together) try to implement the working of each hardware (LCD, IR, RTC) individually for the sample examples.

# NOTE
  1. Change the HEX CODES used in switch statements that are used to take the input from the HEX CODES of your IR REMOTE.
(It may not be same)
  2. Provide 3.3V to LCD display 
  3. Use Resistor while connecting LED bulb
